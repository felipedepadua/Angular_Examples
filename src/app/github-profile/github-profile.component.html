  github-profile works!

<button [routerLink]="['/followers', 1234]" class="btn btn-primary">Next</button>
<!-- You could change the logic and replace 1234 to the follower's id and display info of the next follower
    THIS IS AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO KEEP IN THE SAME COMPONENT AND ONLY CHANGE THE PARAMS
      - NO NEED TO DESTROY THE COMPONENT (WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU CLICK AGAIN IN 'FOLLOWERS' TAB)
        AND THEN CREATE AGAIN WHEN YOU CLICK AT SOME FOLLOWER'S NAME (video 129)

<button (click)="submit()" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
